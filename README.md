# Tensorflow-Flowers-Classification-using-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify five species of flowers: Daisy, Dandelion, Roses, Sunflowers, and Tulips. The model is built to explore architecture choices, regularization methods, and hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy and performance evaluation.
